# Agentic workflow maintenance

The smoke workflow is manually dispatched. Do not run it as part of dependency validation: it uses an authenticated agent on a self-hosted runner.

Its Markdown source is `.github/workflows/self-hosted-agentic-smoke.md`. The compiler version is recorded in the generated YAML header. With gh-aw v0.86.2, regenerate the current action upgrade using:

```sh
gh aw compile self-hosted-agentic-smoke --action-mode action --action-tag v0.89.17 --no-check-update
```

Commit `.github/aw/actions-lock.json` and the generated `.lock.yml` together. Check that the compiler manifest, action summary, and all `uses:` entries agree with the action lock. Compile a second time and verify that no further diff appears.

Dependabot changes `uses:` entries, but does not refresh the compiler manifest or action lock. Review those files whenever it proposes an action upgrade. Specify the intended action tag when using an older compiler; a bare compile uses that compiler's defaults and can undo a newer action pin.

A compiler upgrade is a separate change. It can change permissions, container images, telemetry, and generated job logic. Do not accept that wider diff merely to refresh one action dependency.

The current generated concurrency `queue: max` syntax is newer than some installed actionlint versions. Record an identical baseline diagnostic rather than deleting generated concurrency controls to silence an old linter. Hosted application checks remain required.
