# Native local game

Mode: Operate. Target: Expo/React Native on iPhone and iPad. This is the separate native adaptation requested by issue #42, not a change to the desktop/web system.

Use the established evergreen dice deck, porcelain pip faces and clay action color as the game-specific layer. Use system typography, scalable text, semantic iOS surfaces and text colors, native stack navigation, sheets/alerts and safe areas for the surrounding interface. Do not copy the desktop's dense table or shrink it to phone width.

Compact windows use a vertical play/score flow with a reachable roll action. Expanded iPad windows separate the play controls from the score list. Window width and text scale determine that structure, not a hard-coded device name. All targets are at least 44 points; no fixed-height text containers or decorative permissions, sound, haptics or animation are required.

The local store owns acknowledgment, retries and persistence. Show loading, corrupt/unavailable data, pending-write retry, explicit reload/reset, Resume/Discard and local-only result states. Never imply that a local score is server-verified. Keep one accessible score action per category and describe held/suggested states in words as well as color.

The existing development name is not public branding approval. Support contacts, App Store IDs and final privacy/legal declarations remain unset until approved. Native simulator screenshots must identify their source commit and device; web-adapter tests are only supplemental coverage. Physical-device, VoiceOver, TestFlight and store acceptance remain separate.

Verification is bounded: implement the complete flow, inspect a batched iPhone/iPad light/dark and large-text pass, fix the observed issues together, then one confirmation pass. Native functional failures still need diagnosis and regression tests; do not polish indefinitely.
